Purpose
=======
This describes the operation of the Melag EuroKlav
29V-S. The autoclave is used for three main procedures with respect to
equipment and waste that has been exposed to GMOs and the subsequent deactivation of the GMOs by heat/pressure sterilization:

i) Sterilization of glassware and equipment for reuse
ii) Deactivation of small volumes of liquid and solid media
iii) Deactivation of large loads of  liquid and solid media

Scope
=====
This should be observed every time the autoclave is used within the London Biohackspace BioLab for GMO waste deactivation.

Responsibilities
================
The operator of the autoclave is responsible for their own safety and
that of others in the vicinity during its use. The particular risks
presented in using this piece of equipment are primarily due to the high
temperatures and steam released during evacuation. There is also a risk
of the shattering of sealed glass containers.

Upon removal of items from the autoclave be aware that they will likely
still be hot, and care should be taken to check that glass or ceramic
items are intact.

Suitable hand and eye protection should be worn.

Materials
=========
The autoclave requires a supply of reverse osmosis purified water (**RO water**). If the water supply
level falls below a minimum level, the operator will be required to top
up the system. The RO water is available from the tank under the
counter. The autoclave is filled into the tank from the top of the
machine. Please see `LBL08002 <lbl08002.rst>`__ 
for details of this procedure.

The daily test, and waste deactivation runs of the autoclave require
**autoclave tape**. If we are out of autoclave tape, please email 
`BSO <hello@biohackspace.org>`__ and report that we are out of stock.

Procedures
==========

Daily Test procedure
--------------------

Before using the autoclave for GMO deactivation, the operator
should run a test strip through the autoclave to check that it is
working to specification.

The test strip should be stapled into the lab book, with a note
indicating the operator and the date/time the test was run, along with
any observations.

Sterilization of Glassware
--------------------------

Unwrapped equipment and glassware with no internal cavities can be
sterilized using the Quick Programme (28 psi/134 C/3 mins)

- Transport the equipment to the autoclave in a non-drip autoclavable tray
- Ensure there are no sealed containers which can trap air and present an explosion risk
- Sterilize the load using the Quick Programme (28 psi/134 C/3 mins)
- once the programme has run, the waste should be transferred to storage

Small volume batches
--------------------

Materials such as a solid and liquid media and plastic consumables, 
gloves and other waste for disposal can be sterilized using
the Universal Programme (28 psi/134 C/30 mins)

- Transport the waste to the autoclave in a non-drip autoclavable tray
- Ensure there are no folds in cloth materials
- Ensure there are no sealed containers which can trap air and present an explosion risk
- Sterilize the load using the Universal Programme (28 psi/134 C/30 mins)
- once the programme has run, the waste should be transferred to the chemical kill bin, for final deactivation

Large batches by weight or volume
---------------------------------

Large volumes of liquid or solid media should be processed with
extra care. Typically if a large batch greater than 1kg or 1L should be
separated into smaller batches for sterilization using the procedure above.

If this is not possible, the autoclave should be preheated using the following steps;

The load should be run under the Universal programme

- Ensure there are no folds in cloth materials
- Ensure there are no sealed containers which can trap air and present an explosion risk

- once the programme has run, the waste should be transferred to the chemical kill bin, for final deactivation
