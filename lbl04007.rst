Purpose
=======

This describes the protocol for use of the Kill Bin, which is a Virkon filled
container, located under or near the sink. This bin used for the chemical
inactivation of waste media and contaminated consumables such as disposable lab plastics.

Scope
=====

- This document should be consulted prior to use of the Kill Bin for waste
  disposal.

- The kill bin **is not suitable** for inactivation of GMOs, or plastics and
  consumables which may have come into contact with GMOs. The autoclave should
  be used instead. See `LBL04006 <lbl04006.rst>`__, "Using the autoclave for waste deactivation",
  and `LBL05001 <lbl05001.rst>`__, "Containment Level One for Biolab Users".

- The bin is also not effective for the deactivation of bacterial spores. Waste
  that may contain spores should be autoclaved.


Responsibilities
================
The operator of the Kill Bin is responsible for his or her own safety,
and the safety of others, while disposing of waste.

Suitable hand and eye protection should be worn, particularly when moving and
refilling the kill bin with Virkon.

Materials
=========

- Virkon Powder

Procedures
==========

Disposing of waste in the Kill Bin
----------------------------------

Ensure the Kill Bin has been refilled with fresh Virkon solution in the past 7 days and that the colour of the solution is pink.

#. While wearing gloves, carefully open the lid of the bin. It is opened by turning the handle anticlockwise and pulling upwards.
#. Place any solid waste to be disposed of in the bin, and ensure it is submerged.
#. Pour any liquid waste into the bin and add approximately 1g of Virkon powder for every 100ml of liquid waste added.
#. Replace the lid and lock it by turning the handle clockwise. Ensure that the lid is locked by gently pulling on it.

Material in the Kill Bin should be fully immersed for at least 30 minutes to ensure full inactivation.

Emptying the Kill Bin
---------------------

If the kill bin is full of solid waste or the bin requires refilling with fresh 1% Virkon solution the bin must first be emptied. When the kill bin requires emptying it will likely contain a mixture of 1% Virkon solution, deactivated liquid waste and solid matter.

Gloves, labcoat and eye protection should be worn as a precaution during this procedure.

#. Ensure that all waste has been immersed in the 1% Virkon solution for at least 30 minutes.
#. Decant the liquid into the BioLab sink.
#. Empty the solid matter into the general waste.
#. Thoroughly rinse the bin with tap water to remove any remaining virkon-waste mixture.


Refilling the Kill Bin
----------------------

The 1% Virkon solution in the Kill Bin should be replaced every 7 days or sooner if the solution is no longer pink in colour. This should be logged in the biolab day book.

Labcoat, gloves and eyeprotection must be worn during the refilling procedure. Virkon powder can be a severe irritant on contact with skin, eyes or on inhalation (1% Virkon solution is not an irritant).

#. The bin should be emptied of solids and liquids and rinsed clean with tap water prior to refilling (see above). This prevents accelerated loss of potency of newly added solution.
#. Fill the Kill bin to the desired level with water, 8L is a suggested quantity.
#. Add 10g of Virkon powder for each litre of water added and stir until dissolved.
