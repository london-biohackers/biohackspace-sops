Purpose
=======
This describes the protocol for use of the Kill Bin, which is a
beach-filled container, located under or near the sink, used for the
inactivation of biological waste and disposable lab
plastics which may have become biologically contaminated.

Scope
=====
This document should be consulted prior to use of the Kill Bin for waste
disposal.

Bleach is not effective for the deactivation of bacterial spores. Waste that
possibly contains spores should be autoclaved prior to being placed in the kill bin.

Responsibilities
================
The operator of the Kill Bin is responsible for his or her own safety,
and the safety of others, while disposing of waste. The major danger to
health is the large quantity of bleach contained in the bin. Spilled
bleach can cause severe damage to eyes and skin, and it is harmful if
swallowed, or if its vapours are inhaled. For these reasons, and because
the surfaces of the bin may have been contaminated by waste from a
previous disposal, the bin should used with gloved hands.

Suitable hand and eye protection should be worn, particularly when moving and
refilling the kill bin with bleach.

Bleach is corrosive to stainless steel, therefore bleach should not be left
in contact with utensils or sink surfaces.

Materials
=========
The bin requires a 60/40 bleach/water mix. See the `Refilling the Kill Bin <#emptying-the-kill-bin>`__ section below for more details.

Definitions
===========

	Control of substances haxardous to health


Procedures
==========

Disposing of waste in the Kill Bin
----------------------------------
While wearing gloves, carefully open the lid of the bin. It is opened by
turning the handle anticlockwise and pulling upwards. Place the items to
be disposed of in the bin, and ensure that they are submerged. Replace
the lid and close it by turning the handle clockwise. Ensure that the
lid is properly closed by gently pulling on the lid, which should not
open.

Emptying the Kill Bin
---------------------

The bleach bin **should not** be emptied into the sink in the lab as it does
not exit directly to the waste pipe, but instead to a storage tank.

The bin consists of kill liquid (the water/bleach mix) and solid matter.
The liquid can be disposed of down the drain. The solid matter can be
disposed of into the general waste after the bleach has been removed.

Bleach is considered a hazardous substance under COSHH and therefore the
container contains a warning label. The warnings should be adhered to for
all use of household bleach in the biolab.

The bleach bin should be emptied into the toilet or into an external open
drain. Gloves and eye protection should be worn at all times.




Refilling the Kill Bin
----------------------

Typical household bleach contains 5.25% Sodium Hypochlorite. The solution 
in the bin should be diluted from household bleach so that it contains a
 mixture of 10% bleach and 90% water. 
 
Bleach decomposes over time when exposed to air and so fresh bleach solution should be added to the kill
bin daily.

**WARNING:** Do not mix chemicals such as acids into the kill bin solution
as they will release chlorine gas
