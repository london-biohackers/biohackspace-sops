Purpose
========
In order to satisfy the `Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2014 <http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/l29.htm>`__ [#]_, any CL1 project being undertaken in the BioLab should follow the procedures outlined in this document in conjunction with any procedures specified in the risk assessment for that project .

.. [#] http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/l29.htm

Scope
=====
This relates to all CL1 projects.

Responsibilities
================
This applies to anyone carrying out these procedures as part of a CL1 project. The user should ensure that others do not inadvertently compromise the containment of GMOs.

Procedures
==========

Risk Assessment
---------------
A written risk assessment must be approved before work can commence on any CL1 project (see `BioLab Usage Guidelines <biolab-usage-guidelines.rst>`__ for guidance on determining what is classed as CL1). The risk assessment procedure is detailed in `LBL06001 <lbl06001.rst>`__ .

Worksite
--------
All work with GMOs as part of a CL1 project must take place within the BioLab. The BioLab is equipped with door access control in order to enable restriction of access to only trained users when appropriate. An observation window is also present.

All work with GMMs as part of a CL1 project must be carried out on the wet work workbench (white surface). This bench is impervious to water, resistant to acids, alkalis, solvents, disinfectants and decontamination agents and easy to clean.

Protective clothing
-------------------
Suitable protective clothing should be worn. The `BioLab Usage Guidelines <biolab-usage-guidelines.rst>`__ give guidance on this matter. If suitable PPE is not available, the BSO should be informed immediately before any practical work is commenced.

Inactivation of GMMs
--------------------
All waste (e.g. disposable gloves, cultures of GMMs) produced during a CL1 project must be sterilised using the on-site autoclave according to the standard procedure detailed in `LBL04006 <lbl04006.rst>`__. The user should pay special attention to ensure the autoclave has undergone the daily test procedure.

After autoclaving, liquid waste may be disposed of down the drain, and solid waste may be disposed of as standard lab waste.

Safe storage of GMOs
--------------------
GMOs should be stored in an appropriate area of the BioLab in such a way as to minimise the risk of contamination. The BioLab is equipped with door access control in order to enable restriction of access to only trained users when appropriate.

Transporting GMOs Outside the BioLab
------------------------------------
A written risk assessment must be approved before any GMO may be transported outside the BioLab. The risk assessment procedure is detailed in `LBL06002 <lbl06002.rst>`__.
